Why Python programming is awesome?
Python is considered awesome because it is a high-level, interpreted language that is easy to learn and use. It has a clean syntax, supports multiple programming paradigms, and has a large and active community that provides support and resources. It is also a versatile language, with applications in web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

What is OOP?
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP allows for the creation of reusable, modular code, and also helps to keep code organized and easier to maintain.

“first-class everything”
This term refers to the fact that in Python, everything is considered to be a first-class object, including functions, classes, and modules. This means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to functions, and used in other ways just like any other object.

What is a class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.

What is an object and an instance?
An object is an instance of a class. An instance is a specific occurrence of an object, created from a class.

What is the difference between a class and an object or instance?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object or instance is a specific occurrence of an object created from the class. The class defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have, while an object or instance has its own unique values for the attributes.

What is an attribute?
An attribute is a characteristic of an object or class, such as its color, size, or weight. In Python, attributes can be added to a class or object by assigning values to variables in the class or object.

What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes?
Public attributes are attributes that can be accessed and modified from outside the class. Protected attributes are attributes that can only be accessed and modified from within the class and its subclasses. Private attributes are attributes that can only be accessed and modified from within the class and are denoted by two underscores in front of the attribute name. To access private attributes, you can use the "_ClassName__attribute" syntax.

What is self?
Self is a reference to the instance of the object being operated on, and is used in methods to refer to the object.

What is a method?
A method is a function that is associated with an object or class. It is used to perform operations on the object or class, such as updating its attributes or returning a value.

What is the special init method and how to use it?
The init method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object and set them to the values passed as arguments when the object is created. To use the init method, you simply define it in your class and pass any necessary arguments.

What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding?
Data Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the necessary information. 

Data Encapsulation refers to wrapping data and functions into a single unit, or object, and restricting access to the inner workings of the object. 

Information Hiding refers to hiding the implementation details of a class or object and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the object.

What is a property?
A property in Python is a method that is used to access and manipulate an attribute of an object. It allows for the implementation of getters and setters, which can be used to control access to the attribute and enforce rules for accessing and modifying the attribute.

What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python?
An attribute is a characteristic of an object or class, such as its color, size, or weight. A property is a method that is used to access and manipulate an attribute of an object. Properties allow for the implementation of getters and setters, which can be used to control access to the attribute and enforce rules for accessing and modifying the attribute.

What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python?
The Pythonic way to write getters and setters is to use properties. To create a property, you can use the @property decorator to define a method as a getter, and the @attribute_name.setter decorator to define a method as a setter.

How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class?
You can dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class by simply assigning a value to a new attribute. For example: instance.new_attribute = value.

How to bind attributes to object and classes?
You can bind attributes to objects and classes by simply assigning a value to an attribute. For example: object.attribute = value.

What is the dict of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain?
The dict of a class and/or instance of a class is a dictionary that contains the names and values of all the attributes for the class or object. It is used to keep track of the attributes for the class or object and to allow for dynamic creation of attributes.

How does Python find the attributes of an object or class?
Python finds the attributes of an object or class by searching through the dict of the object or class. If the attribute is not found in the dict, Python will search the class hierarchy for the attribute.

How to use the getattr function?
The getattr function is used to access the value of an attribute of an object. It takes two arguments: the object and the name of the attribute. For example: getattr(object, 'attribute'). If the attribute is not found, the getattr function can also take an optional third argument that specifies a default value to be returned if the attribute is not found.
