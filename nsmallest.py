"""
The .nsmallest() method in Python is a built-in function that returns the n smallest elements from an iterable or a given list in ascending order.

Here is the syntax for using the .nsmallest() method:

import heapq
heapq.nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)

Where:

n: the number of smallest elements that you want to retrieve.
iterable: an iterable object like a list, tuple, or set from which you want to retrieve the smallest elements.
key: an optional parameter that is used to specify a function to extract a comparison key from each element of the iterable. The default value of this parameter is None.
Here's an example of how you can use .nsmallest() to find the smallest elements from a list of integers:
"""
import heapq

# numbers = [5, 3, 8, 1, 6, 9, 7, 2, 4]
# n_smallest = heapq.nsmallest(3, numbers)
# print(n_smallest)  # [1, 2, 3]
"""
You can also use the key parameter to specify a custom comparison function that should be used to determine the smallest elements. For example, if you have a list of tuples and you want to retrieve the smallest tuple based on the second element, you can use the following code:
"""

data = [('apple', 3), ('banana', 2), ('pear', 1), ('orange', 4)]
n_smallest = heapq.nsmallest(2, data, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(n_smallest)  # [('pear', 1), ('banana', 2)]
"""
In this example, we passed the data list, 2 as arguments to the .nsmallest() method, and a lambda function that extracts the second element of each tuple as the key parameter. The result will be the two smallest tuples based on the second element of the tuple.
