static library in C programming
A static library is a collection of object files that are linked with a program at compile time, as opposed to a dynamic library which is linked at runtime. This means that all the code from the library is included in the final executable, making the executable larger but also ensuring that the code will always be available to the program.

An example of a static library might be a math library, which provides common mathematical functions such as square root and trigonometric functions. These functions are stored in object files, which are then collected into a single library file. A programmer can then link this library with their program, allowing them to call the mathematical functions from within their own code.

Creating a static library is typically done using the ar command line tool, which is used to create, modify, and extract from archives. The basic command for creating a static library is "ar -rcs libname.a objectfiles", where libname.a is the name of the archive file to be created, and objectfiles are the object files to be included in the library.

Once a library is created, it can be linked to a program using the linker. The linker takes the object files and libraries used by a program and combines them into a single executable file. The command for linking a static library to a program is "gcc -o program program.c -L. -lname", where program is the name of the executable file to be created, program.c is the source code file, -L. tells the linker to search the current directory for libraries, and -lname tells the linker to link with the library named libname.a.

In summary, a static library is a collection of object files that are linked with a program at compile time, it can make the executables larger but it ensures that the code will always be available to the program. Creating a static library is typically done using the ar command line tool, and linking it to a program using the linker.
